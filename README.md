#  Clima Weather App

## Our Goal

Itâ€™s time to take our app development skills to the next level. Weâ€™re going to introduce you to the wonderful world of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to grab live data from the internet. If youâ€™re dreaming of making that Twitter-powered stock trading app then youâ€™re about add some serious tools to your toolbelt!

## What you will create

By the end of the module, you will have made a beautiful, dark-mode enabled weather app. You'll be able to check the weather for the current location based on the GPS data from the iPhone as well as by searching for a city manually.
